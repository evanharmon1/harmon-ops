(* Script to automatically take the full path of the currently open file in Sublime Text 3, open macOS's Terminal, 
and then run Python3 with that file path as its argument. This is a convenient way to automatically run your current 
code directly in the system terminal and without needing to install any Sublime packages or worrying about caveats 
in an IDE's terminal or Python environments. *)

-- Get file path of current program open in Sublime Text 3. (Needs to have keyboard shortcut setup in the Key Bindings preferences of Sublime to have ctrl+alt+super+k copy_path).
tell application "Sublime Text" to activate
tell application "System Events" to keystroke "k" using {control down, option down, command down}

-- Get current contents of the clipboard and save it to variable clipboard_contents
set clipboard_contents to (the clipboard)

-- Convert clipboard_contents to be properly quoted for BASH to allow for spaces in filenames, e.g.
set python_path to quoted form of clipboard_contents

-- Open Terminal and run the Python program you have clipped in an active, front window. If there is an open Terminal window, script will create a new window. If Terminal is not open, it will open and run it in its window.
tell application "Terminal"
	if application "Terminal" is not running then
		reopen
		activate
		do script "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/python3 " & python_path in front window
	else
		activate
		do script "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/python3 " & python_path
	end if
