# CHECKLIST-WIN.md

Checklist for manual steps to install a new Windows machine from scratch.

- [ ] Configure BIOS
  - Verify component temperatures are ok
  - Verify all fans are spinning
  - Verify all hardware is detected correctly
  - Set boot order
  - Disable Fast Boot
  - Update BIOS firmware
  - Set cooling and fan profiles
  - Enable UEFI/Secure Boot
    - Secure Boot can cause issues with Unraid and some Linux distros. You may want to enable UEFI but leave Secure Boot disabled
  - Enable XMP/DOCP and set correct RAM speed and timings
    - On newer ASUS AMD boards this is labeled EXPO/DOCP II
  - Enable TPM/Trusted Computing
    - Enable fTPM
  - Enable Motherboard Devices
    - Bluetooth
    - LAN
    - WiFi
  - Storage
    - Set NVMe/SATA mode (AHCI vs RAID)
  - Power
    - Restore AC Power Loss
    - Set C-States to enabled — better idle power for 24/7 operation
  - Network
    - Enable Wake-on-LAN
  - Virtualization
    - Enable SVM (AMD-V) — required for virtualization
    - Enable IOMMU — needed for PCIe passthrough to VMs
    - Set ACS Enable if available — better IOMMU grouping
- [ ] Install Windows from scratch
  - Use official Microsoft media creator tool
  - Sign in with Microsoft account
- [ ] Run setupWindows.ps1 setup script
  - Download this repo (harmon-os) to C:\Users\evanh\git
  - Open PowerShell as admin
  - Type `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process` (applies only to current session)
  - Navigate to this script and run it in powershell
- [ ] Install apps that can't be installed automatically (listed in setupWindows.ps1)
- [ ] Map Capslock to Escape key
  - Open PowerToys Settings > Keyboard Manager > Enable Keyboard Manager.
  - Click “Remap a key.”
  - Select Caps Lock as the “From” key, then map it to Escape as the “To” key.
- [ ] Setup SSH
- [ ] Setup Tailscale
  - Join a Tailnet for remote access
- [ ] Setup VNC
  - Install a VNC server like RealVNC Server which works well with Mac Screens
- [ ] Setup Docker Developer Environment on Windows
  - In order to get the dockerVol shared/mounted folder working inside running docker containers, Docker settings need to share the local C drive. Sometimes a restart is required. Sometimes you need to make sure to confirm any pop up windows about sharing volumes. I think I solved some problems by putting my docker-compose and dockerVol at the C:/ root level on Windows systems. There are also some Windows features that need to be enabled like Hyper-V.
